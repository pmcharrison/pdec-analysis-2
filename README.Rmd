# pdec-analysis-2

This R project implements the analyses for 
"A psychological model of auditory predictive processing: 
High-order transition probabilities, recency effects, and sensory memory"
by Peter M. C. Harrison, Roberta Bianco, Maria Chait, and Marcus T. Pearce.

## Installation

These scripts depend on various R packages which can be installed 
with the following commands (Internet connection required):

```r
install.packages(c(
`r paste(paste("'", readLines("packages.txt"), "'", sep = ""), collapse = ",\n ")`
))
devtools::install_github("pmcharrison/PPMdecay")
```

## Usage

a) Open this R project by opening `pdec-analysis-2.proj` in RStudio.
b) Compile the response data by running `src/0-compile/0-compile.R` in R.
c) Conduct the modeling by running `src/1-compile/1-analyse.R` in R.
d) Create the summary analyses by running `src/2-summarise/2-summarise.R` in R.
