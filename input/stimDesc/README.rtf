(contains list of tones in frequency for each trial,\
each trial starts with a new line,\
alphabet size = 10 or 20 tones,\
tone duration = 25/ 50/ 75 ms)\
we set the constraints that:\
- the RAN part of the RANREG trials has at least 80 tones before the transition\
- the transition is jittered within 500 ms time window\
- the REG part after transition has at least 3 repeating cycles \
